## Where would you like to eat?

Chicken Tender is a mobile application to help you and your friends answer that question.

### How!?

* Simply start Chicken Tender and press the button labeled "Create Room". You will be given a code that can be copied and sent to others through a text message.
* When you receive a code from someone else on the app, press the button labeled "Join Room" and paste the code in the input box.

The application automatically locates restaurants near the user who created the room. Everyone who has been invited can then proceed to vote on those restaurants

### Requirements

* Internet access (be mindful of what wifi network you are connected to, as during testing some features were rarely blocked on certain networks)
* Location access on your mobile phone
